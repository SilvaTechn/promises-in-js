# Promises Example

This project is a simple demonstration of using promises in JavaScript to manage asynchronous operations. The code creates an HTML document with a list of posts.

## Introduction

The HTML document showcases the use of promises in JavaScript. It defines an array of posts and two functions:

1. **getPost:** This function displays the list of posts after a delay of 1000 milliseconds using `setTimeout`. It is called after the promise is resolved.

2. **createPost:** This function simulates adding a new post to the array after a delay of 2000 milliseconds. It returns a promise that resolves when the post is successfully added and rejects if an error occurs.

## Usage

To run this example:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/promises-example.git
    ```

2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.

    ```bash
    # Change directory to the cloned repository
    cd promises-example

    # Open the HTML file in a web browser
    ```

The posts will be displayed, and a new post will be added after a delay.
